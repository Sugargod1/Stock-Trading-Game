# Stock-Trading-Game
My teammate, Steven Lintelman Nader, and I worked together to implement this project. I initially came up with the idea to build a Stock Trading Game, and we collaborated closely throughout the development process.
He implemented the Yahoo Finance API to draw stock graphs using Turtle on the canvas, and I reviewed his work. 
I was responsible for the entire UI/UX design and the functionality of all buttons, and he reviewed my contributions.
