# Stock-Trading-Game
My teammate, Steven Lintelman Nader, and I collaborated closely to implement this project. I originally came up with the idea to build a Stock Trading Game, and we worked together throughout its development.

Steven integrated the Yahoo Finance API to display stock graphs using Turtle on the canvas, and I reviewed his work. 

I was responsible for the entire UI/UX design, the logic behind how users make profits or losses, the calculation of overall profit leading to retirement, and I added pause and resume functionality to make the game more user-friendly. 
Steven also reviewed my contributions.
