# Stock-Trading-Game
My teammate, Steven Lintelman Nader, and I collaborated closely to implement this project. I originally came up with the idea to build a Stock Trading Game, and we worked together throughout its development.

Steven integrated the Yahoo Finance API to display stock graphs using Turtle on the canvas, and I reviewed his work. 

I was responsible for the entire UI/UX design, including the logic behind how users make profits or losses by buying and selling at different timestamps.
Additionally, I calculated the overall profit leading to retirement and added pause and resume functionality to enhance the user experience. 
Steven also reviewed my contributions. So, we have built an entertaining application that runs smoothly without any frustrations.
